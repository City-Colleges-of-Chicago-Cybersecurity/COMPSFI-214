First step of the BCP process (project scope and planning and business impact analysis)

The overall goal is to create a Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP)

## Strategy Development

Bridges the gap between the business impact analysis and the BCP developement

Determining risks and where to mitigate and the need for those resources then we can move on to the provisions and processes

## Provisions and Processes

There are three assets a business must protect and that is People, building/facilities, and infrastructure. 

## People

Poeple are the most valualbe assets of your organizations and you want to make sure they are safe at all cost before, during, and after an emergency.
The safety of people must always come before the organization's business goals

## Building and Facilities
Many buidling need specialized facilities to conduct business operations

1. Hardening Provisions
Protecting existing facilities

2. Alterante Sites
If it's not feasible then we need to invest in an alterante site under DRP

## Infrastructure
